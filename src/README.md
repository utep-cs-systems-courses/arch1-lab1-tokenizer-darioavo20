Project 1: Tokenizer
====================
# Instructions:

You should document your tokenizer in this file.

This file is written in the refreshingly simple `markdown` text
formatting language.

To learn about text formatting using markdown, we encourage you to examine 
 - [../README.md](../README.md)
 - the online [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/).


This code works as intended. The only important thing to note is that to access the menu options you have to 
use the '!' and then the number that corresponds with the option you want to choose.
